## Usage

One can either run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required dependencies, or use `setup.py` to do so (through calling `python setup.py build` or `python setup.py install`)

Under the `crawler` folder, `crawler.py` stores the function definitions and `generic_testing.py` contains the generic testing codes (without unit tests yet)

`tests` folder contains files that will be used to run unit tests in the future (currently not implemented), if they are needed later.
